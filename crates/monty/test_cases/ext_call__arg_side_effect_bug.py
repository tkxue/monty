# mode: iter
# BUG: Side effects in arguments are duplicated when external call suspends
#
# When an external call is in one argument position and there's a side effect
# in another argument position, the side effect may be executed multiple times
# because argument evaluation is repeated during resumption.

# Side effect before external call in args
# Expected: side_effect runs once, result is 10 + 3 = 13

assert result == 13, 'ext call after side effect'
